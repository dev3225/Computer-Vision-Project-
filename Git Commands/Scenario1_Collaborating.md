Once you have been added as a collaborator by one of the team members, all you have to do is go to the Git bash or Mac terminal, do a cd Desktop or cd Downloads depending on whether you want to create this local repo on your Desktop or Downloads folder and then do:

git clone https://github.com/tuhinmallick/Computer-Vision-Project-

Here I am trying to clone one of the (private) repos I created for this article but feel free to replace it with your own remote URL. The remote URL to the repo of your interest can be found on the projectâ€™s Github page (see the text highlighted in blue in the image below).
